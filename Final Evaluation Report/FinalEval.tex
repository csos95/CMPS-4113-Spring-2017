	The main objective of SMCS is to help first and second year computer science students become better programmers. This software will calculate and display metrics about the users source code such as lines of code, lines of documentation, cyclical complexity, etc. These metrics will be used to give the user feedback on their code and to correct commonly made mistakes.\\
	
%============================================================================
	{\let\clearpage\relax \chapter{Product Pros and Cons}}
	The following is a list of positive and negative aspects of the SMCS:\\
	
	\section{Pros}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Friendly user interface
		\item Low learning cure
		\item Produces highlighted syntax of input code
		\item Allows for selection of metrics rather than listing all of them
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Cons}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Supports C++, Java, and C only.
		\item In some cases, produces incorrect results for block comments due to negative lookahead regex.
	\end{itemize}

%============================================================================
	{\let\clearpage\relax \chapter{Team Organization}}
	For our team structure, we mostly used a voluntary system but at some points team members were appointed tasks by the group leader. Drafts of documents were completed by individuals and final revisions were done as a team. Also, since our system supports 3 programming languages, we split the implementation into 3 separate groups to decrease implementation time.
	
	

%============================================================================
	{\let\clearpage\relax \chapter{Different Approach}}
	If we were given a second chance, we would like to have met more frequently, however, due to scheduling conflicts we were unable to meet more than twice a week. If we had more time we would have liked to spend this extra time preparing for the testing phase. We also would like to have implemented a more interactive user interface and maybe include more metrics and support more languages such as C\# or Python.


%============================================================================	
	{\let\clearpage\relax\pagebreak \chapter{Future Enhancements/Improvements}}
	In future iterations, we would like to:\\
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Include more metrics
		\item Support more OOP languages like C\# and/or Python
		\item Improve the user interface to be more interactive and appealing
		\item Provide feedback messages to user to suggest improvements that can be made to their code
	\end{itemize}
